# Hi, I’m Panos 👋

I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer with 12+ years of experience building production-ready platforms from scratch.

I specialize in **Laravel**, **Vue.js/Nuxt**, **TailwindCSS**, **MySQL**, and **REST API integrations**. I take pride in delivering full ownership — from architecture and development to deployment, testing, and documentation.

## 🛠️ What I Do

- Plan, build, and launch complete SaaS tools, internal CRMs, and any custom platform
- Work independently or in lean teams — no handholding required
- Design fast, secure, maintainable codebases with clear documentation
- Build tools clients actually use and rely on

## 🌍 Notable Projects
